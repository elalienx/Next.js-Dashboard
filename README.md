# Next.js Dashboard App

This is the default tutorial project of Next.js ([link](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)), covering basics like image and font optimization before diving into React’s latest server-side practices.


## Learnings
1.	Although familiar with image and font optimization since I create El Noticiero news website back in 2015. It was nice to see how the framework abstracts these techniques.
2.	I like the form handling, as it simplifies and decouples the code with numerous form submissions.
3.	My biggest surprise was how server-side code reduces the need for local state, especially the `useState()` hook. I knew server components made `useEffect()` obsolete but I didn’t realize how much useState could be removed as well.
